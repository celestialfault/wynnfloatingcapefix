# Wynn Floating Cape Fix

An incredibly simple single-mixin mod, intended to fix capes floating on [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com/)
when a player has their armor hidden with a Silverbull subscription.

Could this have been PRed to Wynntils instead? Maybe.

Did I want to learn the Wynntils codebase just to PR this (nearly one line mixin)? Not really, no.
